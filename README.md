 Binary Classification of Emotions Using Hybrid Model onSpectrogram Images formed on Beta And GammaWaveFrequencyofGAMEEMO-EEG Signal Dataset.
  
  
  
  
  Abstract:Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition attempts to detect the affective states of humans directly via spontaneous EEG signals, bypassing the peripheral nervous system. In this project, 
  we explore various transfer learning techniques for EEG-based emotion recognition, and focus on the three research tasks outlined as follows:
 1. Converting EGG signal to Spectrogram Images using stft value of EEG signal Dataset
 2. Classification by using Transfer learning Model trained on these spectrogram images.
 3. Using Hybrid Model which has pretrained Transfer learning model as feature extractor and a binary classifier.


    Objectives:
 The aim of this project is to find the effectiveness of transfer learning models and hybrid models in
 predicting human emotions using images formed by Spectrogram .

Dataset:  In this, dataset GAMEMOO is used to evaluate the Pre trained Transfer learning models. Data processing methods and experiment results are presented.
